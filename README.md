== Not intended for production ==

This block served as a personal learning project, a practical exercise in building custom blocks.

== Description ==

Applies a shadow effect to text.

Adapted from the original CSS created as "CSS3 text-shadow effects", a pen on codepen.io by Jorge Epu√±an.

== Features ==

Since this block displays only the result of a single input field, the block would not be visible in the UI if that input were empty. Therefore, the block waits until the DOM is fully loaded, then checks the 'textInput' for content. If it's empty, it disables the main Update button for the post, so a block without content cannot be saved. Conversely, if the field contains text, the button is enabled and content can be saved.

- Text input for effect's target
